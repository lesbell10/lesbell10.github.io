								<p class="p2">Space refers to the vast, mostly empty expanse beyond the Earth's
									atmosphere, where planets, stars, galaxies, and other
									celestial bodies are located. It is characterized by a vacuum, extreme temperatures,
									and radiation. </p>
								<p class="p2">Space has long
									fascinated humans, and space exploration has led to significant advancements in
									science and technology, including the
									development of satellites, space telescopes, and human spaceflight. The study of
									space, also known as astronomy,
									encompasses a broad range of fields, including astrophysics, cosmology, and
									planetary science.</p><br>
								<p class="p2">Space exploration has been driven by a number of goals, including
									scientific research, national prestige, military
									objectives, and commercial interests. Humans have been launching spacecraft into
									space since the 1950s, with the first
									human spaceflight taking place in 1961 by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

									<br><br> Since then, there have been many other historic
									milestones in space exploration, such as the first moon landing, the first space
									station, and the launch of numerous
									robotic missions to explore our solar system and beyond. The study of space
									continues to be an active area of research,
									with new discoveries and advances being made all the time.
