        <p>
          Valérie Plante was elected Mayor of Montreal on November 5, 2017,
          becoming the first woman to be elected in this position. Few had
          predicted that Plante would be able to take down the incumbent mayor,
          Denis Coderre, a former Liberal MP and cabinet minister, at the
          beginning of the campaign.

        <p>
          The Montreal City Council is the governing body in the mayor-council
          government in the city of Montreal,Quebec. The head of the city
          government in Montreal is the mayor, who is first among equals in the
          city council. The council is a democratically elected institution and
          is the final decision-making authority in the city, although much
          power is centralized in the executive committee. The council consists
          of 65 members from all boroughs of the city. The council has
          jurisdiction over many matters, including public security, agreements
          with other governments, subsidy programs, the environment, urban
          planning, and a three-year capital expenditure program. The city
          council is also required to supervise, standardize or approve certain
          decisions made by the borough councils.
