		<p>This was Colorado's third appearance in the Finals. They won their two prior appearances with their most recent against
		the New Jersey Devils in 2001.
		
		Mikko Rantanen led the team in points, scoring 92 overall. Goaltender Darcy Kuemper started 57 times for the
		Avalanche, obtaining 37 wins in the process. However, during Game 1 of their Conference Final series, Kuemper left
		the game with an upper-body injury. Backup goaltender Pavel Francouz finished the opening game after replacing Kuemper
		and started the remaining games of the series as a result. During the off-season, the Avalanche traded for Kuemper
		and forward Kurtis MacDermid. They also picked up free agent Darren Helm. They re-signed defenceman Cale
		Makar, captain Gabriel Landeskog, and Francouz. Nearing the trade deadline, the Avalanche acquired Josh
		Manson, Nico Sturm, Artturi Lehkonen, and Andrew Cogliano.
		
		The Avalanche finished the season with 119 points via a 56–19–7 record, grabbing the Central Division title and first
		place in the Western Conference. Colorado swept the Nashville Predators in four games during the First Round,
		then defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games during the Second Round, before sweeping the Edmonton Oilers in the
		Western Conference Final.</p>

		<h3>Tampa Bay Lightning</h3>
		</div>
		
		<div class="info">
		<img src="https://images8.alphacoders.com/658/thumb-1920-658777.jpg">
		<p>This was Tampa Bay's third consecutive Finals appearance and fifth overall. They won the prior (2020, 2021) two Stanley
		Cups and have won three in franchise history. They were the first team to clinch three consecutive Finals
		appearances since the 1983–1985 Edmonton Oilers. The Lightning joined the Montreal Canadiens (1976–1980) and New York
		Islanders (1980–1984) for becoming the only teams in league history to post at least eleven consecutive playoff series
		victories.
		
		Captain Steven Stamkos led the team in scoring with 106 points during the regular season. Defenceman Victor Hedman
		scored 85 points, eclipsing the previous Tampa Bay record for defenceman, which Hedman set in 2017. During the
		off-season, the Lightning signed goaltender Brian Elliott, defenceman Zach Bogosian, and forwards Pierre-Edouard
		Bellemare and Corey Perry via free agency. They also opted to re-sign forwards Brayden Point and Ross
		Colton and defenceman Cal Foote with Patrick Maroon re-signing during the season. At the trade deadline,
		the Lightning acquired forwards Brandon Hagel and Nick Paul. For Corey Perry, this was his third straight Finals
		appearance with three different teams (Dallas Stars in 2020, Montreal Canadiens in 2021), the first player to accomplish
		this feat since Marian Hossa did it with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2008, Detroit Red Wings in 2009, and Chicago
		Blackhawks in 2010.

		The Lightning finished third in the Atlantic Division gaining 110 points with a 51–23–8 record. Tampa Bay defeated the
		Toronto Maple Leafs in the First Round in seven games,followed by a four-game sweep of their intrastate rival, the
		Florida Panthers, during the Second Round, and then triumphed over the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference
		Final in six games.</p>

		<p>The 2022 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2021–22 season and the
		culmination of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs. The series was between the Eastern Conference and two-time defending
		Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning and the Western Conference champion Colorado Avalanche. The Avalanche won the
		best-of-seven series, four games to two, for their third championship in franchise history. Colorado had home ice
		advantage in the series with the better regular season record.
		
		The series began on June 15, and concluded on June 26. With the Government of Canada allowing cross-border travel for
		fully vaccinated players and team personnel between Canada and the United States, the league was able to return to
		its usual two conference alignment and reinstate its standard playoff format that was used from 2014–2019, before the
		COVID-19 pandemic. The Finals were still pushed from the usual start date in late May for the third consecutive
		year, this time due to a scheduled break in the regular season that coincided with the league's planned
		participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, though the league's players ultimately did not participate in the
		Olympics. When NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman tested positive for COVID-19, NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly took
		over the presentation of the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Stanley Cup. This was the first time since 1992 that Gary
		Bettman did not give the presentation.</p>
